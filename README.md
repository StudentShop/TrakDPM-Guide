# Quick start guide for the TrakDPM-Guide

## What is it?

This guide (created with the [Sphinx Python Documentation Generator](http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html)) gives detailed, step-by-step instructions for running a Trak DPM SX2P. It is designed so that a student who has never run the machine (but has elementary knowledge of a manual mill AND conversational programming) can run the machine by themselves mostly unassisted. The only point at which an instructor needs to intervene is to do a safety/problems check just prior to the student running their part (this crucial step is included in the guide), to explain the Traking feature during the initial phase of running the program, or to answer questions.

## Installation

If you want to simply use the guide:

1. [Download the guide](https://github.com/StudentShop/TrakDPM-Guide/archive/master.zip) or clone it locally with [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/).
2. Navigate to the "build" directory inside the "TrakDPM-Guide" directory.
3. Open any of the .html files in a web browser.

If you want to both use and edit the files:

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (the required version is at least 2.6) and [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/install.html).
2. [Download the guide](https://github.com/StudentShop/TrakDPM-Guide/archive/master.zip) or clone it locally with [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/).
3. Files are edited in the "source" directory and then compiled and stored in the "build" directory. You will need to read the [Sphinx documentation](http://sphinx-doc.org/contents.html) to understand how to edit and compile files.

## Usage

1. Store the guide in a convenient place on your computer. Navigate to the build directory (TrakDPM-Guide/build) and open the file named "index.html" in a web browser.
2. Bookmark that page in the web browser.
3. Whenever you need to read the guide, just click the bookmark in your web browser.

It is also possible to compile this guide into a PDF. See the [Sphinx documentation](http://sphinx-doc.org/tutorial.html#running-the-build) for how to do this.
