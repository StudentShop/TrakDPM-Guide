How do I load my program if I got an error saying my program is too large?

	If you receive an error when loading your program that states your program is too large, you can load the program as a g-code program.  Highlight your program, then `Tab` until you find the `OPEN AS` window. `DATA FWD` or `DATA BACK` until `.GCD`_ is highlighted, then `OPEN FILE`_.

Can I edit my program as g-code?

	Press EDIT, and you are now allowed to press `G CODE EDIT`_.

	The next screen shows you the program in g code form. You can use the `SEARCH`_ to locate the line of code, speeds, feeds, or any other individual piece of the code you may need to modify.

.. Note:: You will need a keyboard to edit the g-code.  We do NOT have a keyboard on this machine.  Re-post your program, rather than trying to edit the g-code at the machine.

Why are drills are moving in my drill chuck?

	You need to make sure the drill goes in as far as the chuck will allow, without clamping on the flutes.  If needed, use a smaller drill chuck.

Why is the screen flashing a "Out of Range" warning?

	You have exceeded the speed range of the spindle.  Check to see if you are in low gear.  If you are in the correct gear, make sure you haven't set your spindle speed higher than the machine maximum of 5000 rpms.
