Tool Setting
************

**Note 1:** You will be :doc:`3-axis <axis>` machining, be sure to select that option prior to setting the `Tool Setting Gage Reference Position` in the tool offsets page.  (This is located under the `SYS button`_).  You will still need to follow this procedure for 2-axis machining.

**Note 2:** :doc:`Load your program <loadingcamprograms>` prior to setting `Tool Setting Reference Position` in the tool offsets page.

Before setting any tool length offsets, you **must** set a `Tool Setting Reference Position`.  You will need a :ref:`reference tool <reftool>` used in conjunction with the `tool setter`_ in order to accomplish this.

---------------------------------------------
Setting the `Tool Setting Reference Position`
---------------------------------------------

A.   Load the :ref:`reference tool <reftool>` into the spindle.  Move the table until the spindle is roughly located over the back vise jaw.
  
B.   Set the `tool setter`_ on the back of the vise, just behind the back jaw.  Make sure the block and vise are clean.
  
C.   Align the reference tool directly over the tool setter (use the X & Y axis hand wheels if necessary).
  
D.   Use `JOG`_ to move the `Z-axis`_ down until the tool setting gage standard is within 3 to 4" of the top of the tool setter.
  
E.   Hit `RETURN`_ to take the machine out of jog mode.
  
F.   Use the manually operated quill feed lever to carefully lower the reference tool until it aligns the needles with 0 on both the outer diameter, and the small scale simultaneously.  `Lock the quill`_ in place once contact has been made.
  
G.   If you are not already in the Tool Table page, hit `MODE`, `SETUP`, and then `TOOL TABLE`_.  Make sure the cursor is highlighting the words `NOT SET`_ under the Z offset column and press `ABS SET`.
  
It should now `read SET`_ under the Z offset column.

Setting the Tools
-----------------

.. warning:: Do not fill in the diameter column when doing 3-axis machining or running a FeatureCAM program, as this will cause the machine to alarm out when trying to run the program.

A.   Move the cursor to the `Ref 1 position`_, all the way to the left under the `DIA` column.  Raise the spindle.  Press `JOG`, followed by the Z-axis button to move the Z-axis up until you can safely remove the reference tool and load tool #1 as set in your FeatureCAM program (use the `+/-`_ key to change directions of jog for each axis).

B.   Once tool #1 is loaded into the spindle, slowly jog the spindle down to within 3" of the `tool setter`_.  Stop jogging and use the manual quill feed lever to carefully lower the tip of the tool until it aligns the needles with 0 on both the outer diameter, and the small scale simultaneously.  Press `RETURN` to get back to the `TOOL TABLE` page.  Make sure the cursor is still in the Ref 1 postion, all the way to the left under the `DIA` column.

.. warning:: When the tool is touching the tool setter, moving the x or y hand wheels will damage the block and tool.

C.   For 2-axis only, enter the actual `diameter`_ of the tool and press `ABS SET`.  You should now see the diameter you entered displayed in the Ref 1, Dia 1 column.  The cursor should automatically move to the right, highlighting the Ref 1, `Z-Offset`_ column.  Press `ABS SET` again and the Z-axis number you noted on the `DRO` page will automatically be loaded into the Ref 1, Z-Offset column.

The cursor will again move to the right, highlighting the `Z-Modifier`_ column.  Pressing the `ABS SET` key will load this column with zeroes and move the cursor to the right.  It will also bring up a small green pop-up window containing a table of 14 different `tool types`_.  Enter the number which best describes the tool you currently have in the spindle, followed by `ABS SET`.  A description of the tool will appear on the screen under the Ref 1, `Tool Type column`_.  (Example: if you have a roughing end mill in the spindle, enter the number 3, followed by `ABS SET`.  Rough end mill should now appear in the Ref 1, Tool Type column.

D.   Manually raise the quill feed lever to its highest position, press `JOG` and move the spindle up high enough to remove tool #1 and load tool #2.  Repeat the process for all of the tools in the program you intend to run.
