The Trak DPM SX2 is intended for medium sized work. The machine's X, Y, Z limits are 32" x 16" x 27" (812.8mm x 406.4mm x 685.8mm) and the table size is 49" x 9" (1244.6mm x 228.6mm). The machine has a spindle speed range of 300 to 5000 RPM with a maximum feed rate of 90 IPM (2286 mm/m) in the X,Y & Z axis. If you need a machine that is capable of handling larger work consider the HAAS VM2 (capable of doing 5-axis work). If you need a machine that is capable of handling smaller work consider the Tormach PCNC 1100 (capable of doing 4-axis work).
