Loading Programs
****************

Place your USB into `one of the ports`_ on the right side of the pendant.

Press `MODE`_, and select `PROG IN/OUT`.

Make sure "List Supported Programs Only?" says `YES`. If not, press `YES`.

Press `OPEN`_.

You will now use `TAB` to find the D: drive and use `DATA FWD` or `DATA BACK` to highlight the `folder`_ your program is in.  Once the `folder`_ is highlighted, press `OPEN FOLDER`.  If you can see your program in the window, you can move ahead to `OPEN FILE`.

Now that you can see your program, use `DATA FWD` or `DATA BACK` to highlight it, and press `OPEN FILE`_ .  If you can't see your program, see shop staff.

Your file will now be loaded into the memory of the controller. Press `PROG`_ and `GO TO BEGIN`_, `GO TO END`, or `GO TO #` and select an event number, to see your program. 

LOOK

At this time you can also press `LOOK`_ to see the `graphical representation`_ of your cutter paths.  It gives you the ability to see your cutter paths in the XY, YZ, and XZ planes, as well as 3D.

`LOOK`_ only works while you are in the program.  Press `MODE`, `PROGRAM`, `BEGINING`, then `LOOK`_.
