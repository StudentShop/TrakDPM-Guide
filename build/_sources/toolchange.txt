Tool Change Reference Position
******************************

.. note:: Set the Tool Change Reference Position to the right of the vise.

Press the `MODE`_, `SET UP`_, and `REF POSN`_ to set the tool change reference location.

.. _`REF POSN`: _images/refposn.jpg

From here you can hit the `JOG`_ and manually move the X, Y, and Z axis to a safe, suitable location for changing tools in and out of the spindle.  The Z-axis needs to be moved high enough above the workpiece to allow your longest tool to easily clear the top of the part when it is being inserted into the spindle.

Press `RETURN` once you have located the X, Y, and Z axis in the position you want.  The reference position page should pop back up on the screen. Use the UP/Down arrows to highlight the words `NOT SET`_ if not already highlighted, and press `ABS SET`.  Notice it `changes to SET`_ and the cursor automatically moves to `X HOME`.  Press `ABS SET` twice more to enter the `X HOME` and `Y HOME` locations into the reference position page.  (These are the actual locations which the machine table is currently positioned.)

The DPM2 will now move to the current table location each time a tool change is called for in a program.

Press MODE to exit the Tool Change Reference Position page.

If the DPM2 is in 2-axis mode, you will not see `NOT SET` on the reference page.

.. caution:: Do not set the limits.
