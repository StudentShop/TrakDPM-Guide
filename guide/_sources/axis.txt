Axis Selection
**************

.. warning:: Make sure you are in 3 axis mode when machining a FeatureCAM program. Use the 2 axis mode when conversationally programming at the machine.

To switch between 2 & 3 axis modes, press the `soft key labeled "SYS"`_ located on the far left side of the pendant. It doens't look like a button, just the letters SYS.


This will bring up the screen where you will be able to `choose between 2`_ and `3 axis modes`_ of operation on the DPM2.


To escape this screen, press `"MODE"`_ and `"DRO"`_. 


If you look at the top of the screen while in "DRO", you will be able to see if you are in 2 axis or 3 `axis`_ mode of operation.
